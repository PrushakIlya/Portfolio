      <h1>Playing in guitar</h1>
      <p>
        The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that 
        typically has six strings. It is held flat against the player's 
        body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the 
        dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing the strings against 
        frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual 
        finger picks may by be used to strike the strings.

      <h1>Front-end</h1>
      <p>
        Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, 
        through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.
        There are several tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal, available that can be used 
        to develop the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks
        marks the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site.

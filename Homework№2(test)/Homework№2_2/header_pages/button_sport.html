      <h1>Deadlift</h1>
      <p>
        Powerlifting is a strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight 
        on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, 
	it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.
	Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as "odd lifts", which followed the same three-attempt format but 
	used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually odd lifts became standardized to the current three.
